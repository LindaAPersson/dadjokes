## User Experience

### Project Goals

The goal for DADJOKES was to create an easy-to-navigate site that users can visit when they lie on the couch watching a bad movie or are on the train during a workday morning. It should be a site where users can get away for a little while.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was used to help prioritize and organize tasks for the hole webpage. I used Project Boards on Github.

* Epics were written containing possible user stories and based on that the website was made.
* User stories were created by looking at epics and added on as the project was advancing.
* Project Board was used to track progression of the task through the Todo, In progress and Done columns

## Design

I want DADJOKES to have a positive feeling, and that is reflected in the choice of light and cheerful colors throughout the site. While the current imagery inventory is modest, each selection embodies a playful and goofy spirit, intended to evoke laughter and joy. The site has a clear structure with the jokes on a white background so they are easy to read.

### Color

This palette of colors laid the groundwork for the colors that ended up on the site. However, it's not the exact color codes, as the Materialize color scheme was predominantly used.

### Wireframes

While planning this site, I sat down with pen and paper and sketched out the outlines of how I wanted the site to be. Since then, the structure and the number of pages have changed. However, the essence of what I drew is still there.
